##### notes  
  * glue components together  
  * **search** for an almost answer using computer, not in math  
    - start from the problem, then split into smaller problems

#### Data Abstraction  
  * Data Abstraction Idea  

    Application Code (using Data) 
    ------ [ interface ] --------
    Data Representatin (bits/bytes)  

  * changing the low-level data representation doesn't need to change the high-level code 


  * TODO  
    - class  

  *  create abstractions that mirror some aspect of your program to work  
    - give you ownership of an abstraction  



#### Adaptation  

#### Programming with objects  

#### State machines
